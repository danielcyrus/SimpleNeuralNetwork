<h4>Image classification with MNIST dataset and dynamic hidden layers</h4>
This a sample of neural network implementation from scratch without any library.

<p>Simply run <b>python3 runTest.py</b></p>
<p>The progress will show you the percentage of 600000 mnist images:<br>

<p>Custom dataset also can train with a range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each pixel, thus, images should be divided by 255.0</p>
<b> img = img / 255.0</b>
<br>
<p>Current output shows, up to 10 images, but it can be changed to <b>any value.</b></p>
